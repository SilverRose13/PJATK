# Tri-city public transport
For those new to public transportation in the tri-city area, fair warning: this is a comedy worthy topic, as proven by Kabaret Pomoże ([Kabaret Pomoże:  Trójmiejska Komunikacja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8chubEKDeg&ab_channel=KabaretPomoze)). Because of their close proximity the tri-cities are often treated, by outsiders, almost as one, but as anyone who has tried to manuver around them without a car knows, there are lines that get crossed and ones that don’t. The two bigger cities- Gdańsk and Gdynia- each have their own public transport management organisations and lines from one city rarely cross to the other. Sopot on the other hand doesn’t have its own public transport management organization and instead uses a mixture its negbours’ public transportation. Are you confused yet? Don’t worry, there is more.
For travelling through the cities and nearby towns, the easiest mode is via the train system or rather systems. The suburban train line (SKM) goes from downtown Gdańsk, through Sopot and Gdynia, then turns North-West and continues all the way to Lębork. The PolRegio trains the other hand, connect Gdańsk and Gdynia to each other through Sopot (i.e. allong the coast) but also meet in Rębiechowo, near the airport in Gdańsk, and continue South-West through Kartuzy to Kościerzyna.
If this short introduction hasn’t convinced you to buy a car or call a taxi, below you’ll find some more in depth explanations and practical tips for manuvering through the tangled web that is the tri-city public transport system. Good Luck.
## Gdańsk
ZTM (Zarząd Transportu Miejskiego w Gdańsku), the organisation in charge of public transportation in Gdańsk includes busses and trams. The ZTM bus routes cover Gdańsk and the surrounding area as well as Sopot and some even venture into Gdynia.
### Tickets
Bus and Tram lines available in Gdańsk require the same type of ticket, which can be purchased at in a ticket machine or through a phone app as well as in select post offices, train station ticket booths and kiosks.
#### Ticket machines
Ticket machines can be found at or near select bus and tram stops and take both cash and card payment. Certain buslines (107, 117, 122, 126, 132, 143, 171, 174, 200, 205, 207, 232, 255, 256, 607, N5) also have ticket machines onboard their vehicles.
#### Phone apps
There are various phone apps which can be used for buying ZTM tickets. This is by far the most convenient option. If you are looking to buy a one-time ticket try **moBILET** or **skycash**. If you’d rather have a time-limited ticket or aren’t sure which will suit you better you can try **GoPay**, **jakdojade.pl**, **mPay**, or **zbiletem.pl**. 
Many of these apps can be used in other cities and for other forms of transport. Some even have other useful features like paying for parking or for cinema tickets. To those of us looking to get somewhere for the first time using public transport in the tri-city area, jakdojade.pl will likely be of most help since the app has a built in map/route planning option that also suggests to the used which tickets will likely be most useful (see Trip planning).
#### Ticket types
##### Single-use and short-term tickets
For a single trip there are two tickets that are likely to be of most use. A **single-use ticket (4,80 pln)** will allow you to spend as much time as it takes on the bus or tram you validate it on. It doesn’t matter how long the planned route usually takes or how much of a delay traffic, roadwork or accidents generate. On the other hand if your route requires changing lines or modes of transport a **75-minute ticket (6 pln)** will let you travel on any ZTM lines for 75 min from the moment of ticket validation.
If you’re planning on traveling multiple times over the span of a day or two you might consider a **24-hour ticket (22 pln)**. 
##### Long-term tickets
Long term tickets are a bit more complicated. You can buy a one-month ticket or if you’re still a student you can get a semester-long ticket. One-month tickets can be valid during week days for users with a registered multi-use ticket or week days and weekends for any bearer. Prices also vary based on the zones your ticket of choice will be valid in, whether it’s valid for a month or a **semester (either 4 or 5 months)**. It’s enough to make your head spin.
For more information on prices, zones and other long-term ticket details consider visiting:  [https://ztm.gda.pl/bilety/bilety-okresowe,a,3020](https://ztm.gda.pl/bilety/bilety-okresowe,a,3020).
#### Reduced Fares
You or your family might be eligible for **reduced (50% of price)** or **waived** ticket fares. 
If you’re looking to buy a semester-long ticket be aware that only a **student** (anywhere from kindergarten to university) is eligible for those. 
For more information about fare reduction criteria visit: [https://ztm.gda.pl/bilety/ulgi-w-oplatach,a,3022](https://ztm.gda.pl/bilety/ulgi-w-oplatach,a,3022).
## Gdynia
Gdynia’s public transport management organisation, ZKM, or Zarząd Komunikacji Miejskiej w Gdyni, includes busses and trolleybusses. The latter are a peculiar combination of busses and trams that do not need to travel on rails but are powered by electricity taken from thick wires stretching over their planned route. It may seem like an abstract system to those who haven’t seen it, but it does have some upsides. It doesn’t require road work to put in tracks, but leaves enough freedom for the trollyebuses to manuver traffic and stop at regular bus stops rather than ones specially built ones by the tracks.
As with Gdańsk city’s ZTM trams, ZKM trolleybuses mostly stick to the city limits while buses operate in Gdynia, the surrounding towns and Sopot. 
For two cities that insist on having their own public transport management, they don’t seem to do much differently form each other.
### Tickets
As ZTM in Gdańsk, by analogy, ZKM tickets are valid in Gdynia-run buses and trolleybuses.
These can be bought in select kiosks and smaller stores (including many Żabka stores), and at some train stations. 
You can also buy tickets through phone apps (**moBILET**, **skycash**, **GoPay**, **jakdojade.pl**, **mPay**, or **zbiletem.pl**). You’ll notice that these are the same apps which allow you to buy ZTM tickets. 
#### Ticket types
##### Single-use and short-term tickets
Like in Gdańsk, if you aren’t a regular public transit user, you have the option of buying a **single-use** ticket, a **75-minute** ticket or a **24-hour** ticket. They even have the same costs at **4.80pln**, **6pln** and **22pln** respectively. Keep in mind though, that even if the ticket is of the same type and cost you still need a **separate ticket** if you’re switching between a ZTM and ZKM bus or vice versa.
##### Long-term tickets
While ZKM has the same types of long-term tickets - **month-long registered, month-long for bearer and semester-long** - as ZTM all tickets are valid **all seven days** of the week. Again, the price varies based on the ticket type and the **zone** it is valid in.
Semester-long tickets are by definition registered for a **single user and only for students**, be it the four-month or five-month option.
For more information on long-term tickets visit: https://zkmgdynia.pl/bilety-okresowe#czytaj. 
#### Reduced fares
Fare reduction, be it **50%** or **100%**, applies to all tickets with the exception of semester-long tickets which by definitionare already issued only to users with reduced fares.

## Sopot
One would think that since Sopot has both ZTM and ZKM bus lines it would have the an excellent public transit system. Best of both worlds, right? Wrong. 
While the dual system gives more variety when it comes to transport options it also creates a lot of opportunity for confusion. Each bus management system still uses it’s own tickets, meaning a potential bus rider needs to know what bus they will be taking. No waiting to see which one comes first. We'll cover Metropolitan tickets in a later section.
The bus is the only mode of public transit available in Sopot besides train. 
## Travelling between cities
We’ve already covered that some ZTM and ZKM lines go into other cities and of course that is always an option as is switching between lines in areas where the two transit systems overlap. An often easier option would be to take one of the train lines. 
### SKM
SKM or Szybka Kolej Miejska w Trójmieście is a suburbar train line which strats in downtown Gdańsk (Gdańsk Śródmieście), goes through Sopot then Gdynia and continues north-west. It has numerous stops in each of the three cities making it a convenient commute between, and often with, the three cities.
#### Tickets
You can buy SKM tickets at ticket counters at most SKM and PKP ticket counters and in ticket vending machines in both these options you should be able to pay with cash or by card. Otherwise you can buy them through a mobile app (**SkyCash**, **jakdojade.pl**, **KOLEO**, **BILKOM**), or the [**skm.pkp.pl**](skm.pkp.pl) website.
Keep in mind that if you buy an SKM ticket at a ticket machine or at the station you might need to get it **validated**. If that’s the case, make sure you do so **before** getting on the train as ticket validating machines are on the train platforms.
If you’re running late and you don’t get to buy or validate a ticket before getting on a train you can ask the **conductor**, but for this you have to make sure you find him right away or you might end up paying a fine instead of fare. It’s also important to note that validating a ticket on the train will **cost extra**.
##### Ticket types
There are various SKM ticket types, for single travelers, groups, certain time frames, etc. The price, however, varies based on the distance you want to travel and various and various forms of reduced fares.

### Polregio
Polregio is a company that operates regional trains all over Poland. In the tricity area it connects **Gdańsk Wrzeszcz** with the **airport** and then goes on to **Gdynia Główna** visiting many of the districts that the more direct SKM line misses. It also follows the SKM line from Gdańsk Wrzeszcz to Gdynia Główna through Sopot.
#### Tickets
You can buy tickets through all the tradition routes- at a ticket counter, through ticket vending machine, on the internet or through phone apps (**Polregio, SkyCash, BILKOM, e-podroznik.pl, KOLEO**). It is, however, worth noting that if you can’t buy a ticket beforehand and want to buy one from the **conductor** you should **enter the at the front** of the train and let the conductor know right away that you want to purchase a ticket. You should also take into consideration that buying a ticket on the train comes with an **extra fee**.
##### Ticket types
Polregio tickets work similarly to SKM tickets where the **price varies on the travel distance** and any fare reduction that might be applicable.
To see how much a trip would cost you or how much of a reduction you might get visit:

### Metropolitan tickets
For those comuters who know they will have to take multiple forms of transport or travel between cities MZKZG sells tickets that work on multiple forms of transportation. Depending on the ticket you buy they can work from on Gdańsk and Gdynia bus, tram, and trolleybus lines or up to all local lines including trains.
##### Ticket types
For short term tickets the prices are the same as for ZKM and ZTM (**4.80pln** for a single ride ticket and **6pln** for a 75-minute ticket) if you buy them on a phone app (**GoPay**, **jakdojade.pl, moBiLET, mPay, SkyCash or zbiletem.pl**) but interestingly buying a **paper version** of a single ride ticket will cost **5.20pln**.
MZKZG, or MZK for short, also offers **24-hour**, **72-hour**, **30-day** and **monthly “combined” tickets**. The first three are pretty self explanatory, but the combined tickets are an interesting option that combines a reeegular monthly MZK ticket with a discounted **monthly ticket for rail options** (i.e. SKM and Polregio.)
As with ZTM and ZKM tickets **50%** fare reduction applies to students and other select individuals.

## Trip planning
### Jakdojade.pl
Jakdojade.pl is a relatively popular phone app and functions in most larger cities in Poland. It works like any electronic map or GPS system but instead of giving you car route options it gives you public transit ones. You can also use it to buy ZTM, ZKM, MZK and SKM tickets. Unfortunately you won’t be able to buy Polregio tickets here, but unless you’re specifically interested in those jakdojade.pl will likely serve most of your public transport route planning needs.
### Google Maps
Unlike jakdojade.pl the regular Google Maps app or website won’t sell us any of the tickets we might need to get around using public transit. However, they do have the schedules of all the abovementioned forms of public transport and the interface is more intuitive, let’s you add stops, takes into consideration modes of transport, such as biking, as alternatives for some sections of the route and is simply more familiar to those of us who use the internet to find directions.
### SkyCash
While Skycash won’t help you navigate the tricity area it is the only mobile app that will let you buy tickets to all four modes of transport described above, so if you’re already familiar with your route and know it requires some manuvering between ticket types, this might be a good option for you.
### For dog lovers
For those of us who love animals, I have some good news. Costs for travelling with a dog on public transit is pretty standard in terms or rules and cheep in terms of costs. If you are travelling with a dog make sure he or she is **leashed**, wears a **muzzle** and that you have certification of their rabies shots **with you**. If you choose to take a bus, tram, or trolleybus, be it ZTM or ZKM, your pet’s trip will be **free** but if you decide on taking a train your pet’s fare will always be **3 pln** whether you need to go one stop or ten.
### Alternatives
For those out there who don’t have a car but aren’t in a particular hurry biking part of the way can be a good alternative. 
What with office jobs and computers many of us don’t get enough exercise, and what better way to start the day or relax after work? Besides what if it’s that or waiting around in traffic or on a crowded train?
Lucky for us there are numerous bike lanes throughout the tri-city area, some of them allong roads but equally as many allong the coast and let’s not forget the Tri-city Landscape Park, the paths there might not be marked for bikes but many or them are asfalt. Not to to mention the great views and fresh air.
## Conclusion
There are, of course, other modes of public transport within the tri-city area, including but not limited to water trams and Polish State Railways (PKP), but described above are the options locals know and use everyday. The entire system stems from a time when Gdańsk, Sopot, and Gdynia weren’t quite as closely knit either geographically or culturally, so don’t worry if it becomes a bit overwhelming. Odds are once you go out there and get familiar with a couple of routes, the rest will fall into place. Good luck and happy travels.
